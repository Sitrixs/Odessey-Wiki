**For Backers**
This mod works like any other mods on workshop.
If you are backer and you pulled the mod files from the early access repository, then simply add the PBO files to your server mod pack.
Don't forget to sign then :)

**For DayZ Server renters:**
If you are using DayZ server hosters like GTX gaming or any other platform that runs your game server, you can use their mod managers as per usual, those will be able to find the Odyssey Mod pack through workshop. 

**For Omega manager:**
For those who are using Omega manager, you can use the mod menu to download the mod like any other mod.

**For GigaChad hosters:**
For TechWizards and Gigachad admins your favorite CLI command prompts ways are valid. 

Currently the mod is all client side therefore there is no need for standalone "server mod" portion, if anything will change it will be noted on the Wiki and the updates channel. 


So on whatever platform you are using, make sure that the files are downloaded the PBO's are signed and the keys are present in the keys folders.

If all is done you are good on this step, proceed to the next.
