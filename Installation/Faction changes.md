In the current version of the mod.
The players are bound by their choices, so they are locked in once they select their faction.
To allow them to choose again, in the current stage, the admin will be required to tweak their faction name in the database file of the player, or simply by deleting the player file from the database folder.


This can be done by the admins.

The admin will need to access the profiles folder and from there FactionManagement folder --->database folder.
From there find the  .json file with the player's steam ID and simply deleting it.
On flip side the admin can access the file and change the faction variable to the desired faction of the player. 

However i highly recommend at this stage just to delete the needed player file, as it will save you some headache in the long run.
