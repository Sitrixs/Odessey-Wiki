Here you will find the information regarding the spawner menu.
Provided the modification was successful installed and configured your players will be greeted with the following menu once they are in game.

Here they will need to perform a few simple actions before they will begin their play session.

First will be to select their faction, by clicking on the "Faction" button, once the selection has been made it is final.

![[Pasted image 20240401224613.png]]
Keep in mind currently there are 12 selection available in the following order.
Bandits/ClearSky/Duty/Ecologists/Freedom/FreeStalkers/NISG/Mercenaries/Military/Monolith/Renegades/Sin .

Keep in mind that factions are configured based on the taste of the administration, so your gameplay for each faction member may vary in gear and available options presented on the server.
Once the selection has been made it is final.

Here i picked to play for free Stalkers, so i got the access to the starting pool available to the free stalkers.

At the bottom right you can see there are two rows, one has "Points Left" and the other has points used, each faction allocates a number of points to their faction members, these points can be cashed in for the starting gear available in the loot pool for each faction.
So you can pick and choose either to spend your points on more quality gear but take overall less amount of gear, or grab a lot more gear but of lower quality, so choose wisely, again this is totally up to the server admins how they want to configure their starting gear economy.

Your loadout will be saved, so no need to start scrolling through all the options again, however if you would like to change your loadout you can still do that.

Once you are ready for your adventure, click the start button, you can also change the spawn location available, depending on what the admins configured.

Enjoy your trip into the zone Stalker!
