If all went according to plan, and your game server booted up as it should.
Then you should visit your "Profiles" folder.
This neat little sucker should get a new folder containing the Odyssey config files.
Example:

One of them will be the **"FactionSpawnManagement"** folder.
This one will contain the configuration file and the database folder generated for each player as well as some useful debugging logs.

So to configure your STALKER factions navigate to the FactionSpawnManagment and click "Config" from there open the  FactionSpawnManagementSettings.json. 
This file will contain the configuration of all factions that a player can pick.

In that little file you will find a large array of settings that will allow you to configure the spawn of each faction to your hearts desires.
To [[Faction Spawn Management Settings .json]].
